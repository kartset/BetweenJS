Update Log v 0.9.8 :
- Includes Type & Pkg

Update Log v 0.9.7 :
- No more event handling in this framework, no need for a half-feature,
since we're trying to optimize calculations, base tweens should not be EventDispatcher
when simple closures are way lighter.
In a close future, a module will be done in StrawExpress, that will overload Tweens 
to make them EventDispatchers if still needed.


Update Log v 0.9.6 :
- Changed Class system again, no closures, more simple and readable --> quicker
- Fixed -Nothing happening- bug on Safari with span-like Elements.
- Fixed critical error at loading in Evt implementation from Naja Framework.



Update Log v 0.9.5

- Works on all kind of objects
- All units available
- Lighter class system
- Color (hex, rgb & hsv)
- scrollLeft/scrollTop properties
- custom tween & easing interfaces available
